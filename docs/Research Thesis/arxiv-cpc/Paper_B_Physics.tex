\begin{abstract}
We report a computational study of quantum correlation dynamics in channels with special-relativistic velocity corrections. Using the QSOT-Compiler framework, we sweep $\beta$ from 0 to 0.99 for a phase-damping channel and track coherence $C_{l_1}$ and non-Markovianity $\mathcal{N}$. We identify a velocity threshold $\beta_c \approx 0.88$ at which coherence collapses while memory backflow increases, a phenomenon we call Relativistic Coherence Sudden Death (RCSD). RCSD is distinct from time-driven ESD because it is induced by observer motion at fixed laboratory time. We outline an uncertainty-quantification protocol and provide reproducibility scripts and data for verification.

\section{Introduction}
The interplay between quantum mechanics and special relativity dictates that quantum resources are observer-dependent. While Entanglement Sudden Death (ESD) is well-known in open quantum systems, its relativistic analogue remains under-explored numerically. Recent satellite and free-space QKD experiments provide a concrete experimental context for long-distance quantum channels and high-speed polarization modulation \cite{Khmelev2023,Mishra2021,Wang2024}. RCSD differs from ESD by being driven by observer velocity (parametric in $\beta$) rather than by elapsed laboratory time at fixed frame. A companion methodology manuscript (Paper A) describes the QSOT-Compiler architecture (arXiv: pending). Source code and archived releases are available on GitHub and Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18035432).

\section{Theoretical Framework}
We consider a qubit undergoing a phase-damping channel $\mathcal{E}_t$. Under a Lorentz boost with velocity $v$, the interaction time dilates, modifying the channel's Kraus operators. The effective damping parameter $p$ transforms as $p' = 1 - (1-p)^\gamma$.

\section{Uncertainty Quantification}
To quantify numerical and sampling uncertainty, we perform Monte Carlo resampling across random seeds (and, where applicable, small perturbations of channel parameters). For each $\beta$, we compute $C_{l_1}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ and report the mean with standard deviation $\sigma$. This uncertainty reflects numerical variability and model sensitivity; it should be interpreted separately from floating-point precision limits (\~$10^{-16}$).
\section{Results}

\subsection{Relativistic Degradation}
We simulated the evolution of a maximally coherent state $|+\rangle$ under boosted damping channels. Figure \ref{fig:decay} illustrates the dual phenomenon: the decay of coherence and the rise of memory effects.

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:decay} is generated with grid lines and a colorblind-friendly palette (see scripts/plot_paper_figure.py).

\subsection{Numerical Evidence}
Table \ref{tab:results} presents the numerical values obtained from our simulation. A striking crossover occurs near $\beta_c \approx 0.88$, where memory effects begin to dominate over coherence. At $\beta = 0.99$, coherence is effectively extinguished ($<0.01$), while memory backflow peaks.

0.8858 & 0.0898 $\pm \sigma_C$ & 0.1218 $\pm \sigma_N$ \\
0.9379 & 0.0345 $\pm \sigma_C$ & 0.1490 $\pm \sigma_N$ \\
\textbf{0.9900} & \textbf{0.0098 $\pm \sigma_C$} & \textbf{0.1835 $\pm \sigma_N$} \\
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

We compute $\sigma_C$ and $\sigma_N$ using Monte Carlo resampling over $N_{MC}$ runs (set $N_{MC} = 30$ in the released benchmark script).

\section{Discussion}
The results suggest that information lost from the system at relativistic speeds is increasingly retained in the non-Markovian memory of the environment. We formalize this as a phenomenological relation $C(\beta) + \alpha \, \mathcal{N}(\beta) \approx \text{const}$ over the studied range, with $\alpha$ fit from data. This is a model-level observation, not a fundamental conservation law; further validation across channels and noise models is required.

Experimental verification could use effective-relativistic simulators, e.g., photonic waveguides with engineered loss, trapped-ion platforms with tunable dephasing, or superconducting circuits implementing time-dilated channel parameters. Because direct access to $\beta \approx 0.88$ is impractical, low-velocity expansions (e.g., perturbative $\gamma \approx 1 + \beta^2/2$) or effective channel dilation can be used to extrapolate toward $\beta_c$ in a controlled setting \cite{Khmelev2023,Mishra2021,Wang2024}.

\section{Conclusion}
We have numerically demonstrated Relativistic Coherence Sudden Death using the QSOT-Compiler. The discovery of a memory-coherence crossover point provides a new metric for analyzing relativistic quantum channels.
