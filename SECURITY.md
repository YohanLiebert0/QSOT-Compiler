## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of our quantum engines and scientific data seriously. If you find a vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

### Reporting Process
1. Email your findings to **security@flamehaven.org** (or use our designated Sovereign Channel).
2. Include a detailed description, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
3. Our **Aegis-C Security Modal** will evaluate the report within 48 hours.

## What Constitutes a Security Issue?
- **Cataclysmic Risks**: Exploits that allow arbitrary code execution or unauthorized system access.
- **Data Poisoning**: Vulnerabilities that could lead to the silent corruption of quantum state tensors (Axiomatic Drift).
- **Secret Leaks**: Exposure of API keys or sensitive configurations in logs/artifacts.

## Atonement & Fixes
Upon verification, we will issue a security patch and credit the reporter in our **History Journal**. We follow a responsible disclosure policy and aim to fix critical issues within 7 days.
